In July, I didn't launch a standalone product. Instead, I was trying to enhance the ones I shipped previously.

<!-- more -->
I spent the most time on [Story View](https://storyviewplugin.com/), itâ€™s still my most successful product with more than $250 revenue till today. As Iâ€™m rolling out updates to the plugin frequently, at the beginning of July I changed the way I do that. More about that in [this milestone.](https://www.indiehackers.com/product/story-view/-LjoWy20Zp9uTy5W2KXA)

These are the features I added to Story View in July:
* Custom colors for texts and text backgrounds
* Display/Hide story controllers (previous/next buttons)
* Default AMP settings
* Default settings
* Support multiple Story View buttons on the same page

Most of these were in my backlog when I launched the product, but luckily, some of them were requested by customers as well, so I hope this means that the plugin evolves in the right direction.

Iâ€™ve also updated the landing page of the plugin because most of the new features werenâ€™t visible there.
I still have to work a lot on talking about the capabilities of the plugin, so Iâ€™ll create short videos about different sections of it.

### My first open source project

Besides winning the category of desktop apps in Makers Festival, Maker Goals Menubar became my very first [open-source project.](https://github.com/feriforgacs/producthunt-maker-goals-menubar)
In July, I spent a few days refactoring the code before making it available to everyone, as this was my [first desktop, react, electron, etc application](https://feriforgacs.me/2019/06/17/my-first-desktop-application/).
The hardest part was to create the readme file with all the necessary information ðŸ˜… I just realized how hard it is to add the right amount of information to it in a format everyone will understand. I havenâ€™t received any complaints about it yet, but I think thatâ€™s because no one took a close look at it ðŸ˜„
So kudos to all open source developers who create a nice readme and documentation for their projects.

[HashtagCalendar](https://thehashtagcalendar.com/) is still doing great with an average of 5-10 visitors a day, so I spent some time trying to get some press coverage for it. Well, without any luck. At least, I got some responses this time. Just the thought that someone read my message and spent some time to send me a response makes it easier to get over the rejection.

Iâ€™ve spent some time to enhance a few features of TWiS and CreativeDEVjobs as well, but nothing significant happened with those products.

Iâ€™ve learned the basics of Shopify extension development as well (I followed [this tutorial](https://developers.shopify.com/tutorials/build-a-shopify-app-with-node-and-react)) because I have a product idea that I think could work on that platform pretty well.
If everything goes as planned, Iâ€™ll start to work on it at the end of August, at the beginning of September.

At the moment, Iâ€™m working on my [Fixathon](https://fixathon.io/) project, and Iâ€™m using my [newly learned Node.js skills](https://twitter.com/feriforgacs/status/1158407712549588992) for that.

I have a [few more things](https://www.notion.so/6aed76661e4b426b92cd4693996dd072) to add to Story View this month as well so August is gonna be pretty busy.
