I'm working on the UI of the form editor. It still looks bad but at least the inputs have a nicer look now. I know making the select fields look pretty would take some time. I definitely don't want to make custom selects as that would take just way too much time. Especially if you'd like to make one that is accessible.

I'm wondering, what is the better option to show when a field is required? If I use a label, users should be able to change or translate the label. An asterisk would probably do the job, but based on [this article](https://uxdesign.cc/form-field-required-vs-optional-9b4d7cdbf400), it could be misleading. Also, there is [this other article](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/required-fields/) that says, it's okay.
