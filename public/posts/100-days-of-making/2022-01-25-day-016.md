Back to code. I'm working on the feature to update the label of the submit button.

<!-- more -->

I'm thinking about doing this a bit differently than Tally. In their case, you have to click on a cog icon to reveal an input where you can update the label of the button. I'd like to skip that and just make the button text editable as it is. As you can edit the field labels the same way, I think this would be more convenient.

I'll probably need this "cog" solution later on, because I'd like to provide a feature where users can change the color of the submit button and show or hide an icon in front of or after the button label. But this is not a feature for the mvp.
