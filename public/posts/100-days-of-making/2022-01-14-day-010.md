I have to change the way I feel about doing marketing vs writing code.

<!-- more -->

At the moment, when I say I’m working on marketing, I spend most of the time reading articles, watching videos, looking for online communities of Notion users and reading their questions. I’m also crafting content, campaign and feature ideas based on my findings. But while I'm doing this I keep thinking about how much code I could have written during this time and how much the product would've evolved. I used to feel the same way while I was working on other products in the past. But I know that both are necessary for the app to succeed. Probably once the mvp is done, it’ll be a bit easier.
