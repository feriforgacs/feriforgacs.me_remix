Now the checkboxes look better as well, so I’m working on the select / dropdown field now.

<!-- more -->

I also added another item to the backlog. While I was working on the checkbox design, I realized that for multiple checkboxes fields I should provide a function to make them single choice. So show radiobuttons instead of checkboxes. Maybe I should provide this option to select fields as well. As far as I remember, when you have just a few options in your select, from a UX perspective it is better to show all of them because it’ll be easier for the users to scan all of them without clicking on the select.

Of course, there is a NN article about this [https://www.nngroup.com/articles/listbox-dropdown/](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/listbox-dropdown/)
