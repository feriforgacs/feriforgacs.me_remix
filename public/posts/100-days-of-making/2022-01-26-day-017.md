Finished the submit button label update feature yesterday. Today I’m working on the part, where users can update basic settings of the form (like success and error messages).

<!-- more -->

The form field editor seems to be done, but I have to double check it. I don’t know if I should use a custom date picker for the date inputs or I can use the default one provided by the browser. At the moment, I prefer the default one, because that means I don’t have to add another dependencie to my app.
