Started to work on the editor layout. First I wanted to go with a “traditional” solution, form fields and other settings on the left, form preview on the right.

<!-- more -->

But as the users of the app are familiar with the Notion UI, I wanted to create something similar to that. I don’t know if they were inspired by Notion or not but I think, Tally is doing something similar, so I decided to follow their solutions.

Later, I’d like to offer some layout customization options as well and I’m not sure how that’ll work with this UI. We’ll see if that feature would be necessary at all.

Sidenote: what is the proper way to draw a nice cog???
