Today, I’m working on the editor UI again. I’d like to finish the options to mark a field as required, hidden. If those won’t take much time, I’d like to work on the feature to update the field labels as well.

<!-- more -->

While I was working on this, I also realized, that I’ll have to create a field synchronization function, because if there is a new field in the Notion database, or one gets removed, somehow, that should be reflected in the form as well. Probably, this is not something for the mvp, but should be on top of my todo list (next to the file upload feature).
