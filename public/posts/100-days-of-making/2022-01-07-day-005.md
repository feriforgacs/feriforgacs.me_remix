I spent some time to sign up to a bunch of apps to see how their onboarding works and I was also curious about the welcome email they are sending to their new users. I'm not good at writing these emails from scratch so I was looking for some inspiration.

<!-- more -->

To my welcome email, I'll definitely add a GIF that shows me celebrating a new signup. This is something I wanted to do since I received a similar message from buffer, years ago. I think it's not just funny, but also sets a tone of voice. It can be also a great occasion to communicate that there is a real person behind the product who is here to help. At the beginning I'll try to talk with my users as much as possible, and I think that if they can attach a face to a name, they'll be more open to the idea of starting a conversation. Again, this is just an assumption.
