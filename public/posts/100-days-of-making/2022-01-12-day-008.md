Eight days in and I just can’t tell how naive I was when I thought that this could be done in a few days. Especially when I’m not working on this full time.

Still hammering the UI of the form editor. If I'd use a CSS framework I could speed up the process. I guess, these days Tailwind is the go to tool when it comes to these types of tasks, but I haven’t used it before and I don’t think this is the right time to learn it. Maybe later I’ll switch to that. Not like any of the users would care, but for easier maintenance.
