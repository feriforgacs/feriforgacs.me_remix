Yesterday, I finished one of the use case articles, so I'm working on the other one today.

<!-- more -->

In the past, when I was working on other projects of mine, creating these articles was one of the last steps before launch and it felt even more time consuming than now to write them, because the product was ready to go, but I didn't want to push it live without providing some kind of context with these use cases. I'm glad that I chose to do a bit differently this time, but I still have to force myself to work on them instead of writing code.
