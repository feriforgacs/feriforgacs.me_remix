I'm not allowed to touch the code today, I have to work on a distribution strategy.

Once the mvp is ready, I'll probably post it to some online communities where there are a bunch of Notion users.

This time, I'm not going to launch the product on Product Hunt right away, I'd like to setup some kind of onboarding flow before that. I'd like to avoid a situation where someone gives a try to the app and forgets it almost immediately. I'd like to send these users at least an automated message a few days later to get some feedback.

Detailed use cases could be beneficial as well, so I'll create a few of those.

I'd like to acquire as many users via SEO as possible. And this is something I can start to work on even without an MVP.
