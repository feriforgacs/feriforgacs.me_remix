Still working on the editor UI. Started to implement the sortable fields funtionality.

<!-- more -->

I was thinking about building the form editor with a mobile first approach, but I’m afraid I have to let that go for now. Though the UI is not too complex, my assumption is that the early adopters of tool will use it on desktop. I know, that’s just a guess, but hopefully, I’ll be able to find out soon enough if the mobile layout is a dealbreaker or not.

I’m also working on some “marketing strategy”. Well, it’s not really a strategy but a collection of ideas on how to acquire the first users. I’ll work on that in the next two days.

Yesterday, I started a feature backlog list as well and I’ll probably make that a public roadmap later on.
