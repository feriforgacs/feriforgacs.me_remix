At the end of last week, I reached one of my yearly goals. I've read 6 books by far and while I updated my goals subpage I also realized that by the end of the year I'm not going to publish 30 blog posts if I don't change my writing habits. So, that's what I'm doing now :)

<!-- more -->
It's not like there is nothing I could write about, but it is always at the end of my todo list. Probably it's also not a good thing that I had to add it to my todo list, I think this should be a simple habit I'm doing on a regular basis.

When I started this "blog" my main idea was that I will use it to summarize my thoughts about my projects, document my progress and share some ideas with other makers. At the moment, I don't feel I made a good job at this.

My main problem is (besides everything feels more important than publishing a post...) that when I finally have the time and motivation to write something, I have no idea what I should write about.

To get rid of this problem I started to take short daily "logs" about the things I was doing on a specific day. I started it yesterday, and I hope this will help me to make it a habit.
Basically, I'm following the idea [200 words a day](https://200wordsaday.com/) was built on but instead of their platform I'm using my personal website to publish the updates.

Probably I could do the same thing on Twitter, but now that I finally decreased the time I'm spending on it, I don't want to fall back :) It's not that I think Twitter is wrong, but I spent too much time on it just by reading interesting stuff. That won't help me pay my rent next month :D

So the first weekly backlog post is coming at the end of this week and my goal is to keep them coming at least by the end of this year.
